## CHAPTER 6 - IIFE

Hi Everyone! We are back with yet another episode of JS Lab. 

In this chapter, you will be learning everything about *"Immediately Invoked Function Expression"* a.k.a IIFE.

Demystifying IIFE üëáüèª

 IIFE is a JavaScript Function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is a design pattern that essentially contains two parts:

- It is an anonymous function with its lexical scope enclosed within parenthesis ( ).
- Creates the immediately invoked function expression ( ).

### Why do we need IIFE:
We know that functions in JS have local scope. For eg: there are multiple .js files in your applications over a while. It's highly possible that functions with the same name exist across files.

In such scenarios, a single web page could include all these .js files, polluting the global scope by having two or more functions/variables with the same name.

### How to write IIFE:
IIFEs are very useful because they don't pollute the global object and they are a simple way to isolate variable declarations.

This is the syntax of IIFE:

IIFEs can also be defined with arrow functions.

Here is a comparison between a normal function definition and IIFE.
